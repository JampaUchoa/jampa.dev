## Motivation

Most companies do not have clear goals on a career path for engineers, most have vague objectives like "mid-levels help their team, oh and juniors also do that as well" and a lot of wishful thinking.

This post aims to give transparency in technical and soft skills are evaluated in order to get an engineer promoted, having a guide on how to look for opportunities to operate on a higher level, and how to get promoted in a company setting when there are a lot of moving parts. 

## How do promotions happen?

### Inside the company

When a promotion happens it will be an obvious thing to do for the company rather than a bet. 

Since it is not possible to demote someone, the company will have to be at least 80% sure that the candidate will succeed in the new role, this happens by analyzing if they are already at the level that they will be promoted.

A promotion committee wants to make sure that the IC can be relied on to operate at the next level at all times after being promoted. If not, the engineer will lower the company bar and demotivate others.

The bigger the company is the more time the IC has to wait to be promoted, due to bureaucracy and longer processes. Working for smaller promising companies is a huge opportunity to get tons of knowledge and a boost in one's career, providing that the company is succeeding.

### Outside the company

In an ideal world, the engineer would be promoted as soon as their skills would reach consistency at the required bar, but is not uncommon for that not to happen at all.

Often what ends up happening is that they are getting more things done and are just rewarded with more responsibilities.

This generally does not happen out of maliciousness, but out of a lack of care, managers are not incentivized by metrics to promote, so bad managers won't care unless they think the engineer will leave, which most will do, eventually.

One way to establish these new skills is to start with a clean slate by interviewing and getting hired by other companies, your manager might not care, but you should.

## The SWE Path

I recommend for those looking to advance their skills look at what's immediately the next step in the ladder and seek opportunities as they arise to reach to develop those skills.

### Junior Engineer

The Junior Engineer is a transitory level that consists of people that have good abilities in programming but are starting on projects that have multiple people involved. The progress in this role just learning software engineering but also diverse architectures, and most importantly the best practices of software development.

**Work**: Junior engineers are expected to tackle individual features within a project and with some external help from their seniors. Being able to deliver simple features inside a larger project with minimal help when on a fixed scope, writing code without too much supervision.

**Communication**: The desired level of communication is to maintain good communication among the technical members of the team, asking for help when it is needed and pointing out when they are blocked by external factors, getting more context about the project and business.

**Expectations**: Learn the software development lifecycle practices, methods, conventions, and industry standards as they progress. Show constant improvement in code quality and reduces the number of pushbacks in code review throughout time.

Some examples of atomic-level tasks, with well-defined specifications:

- Build an endpoint with the specification that was defined in an architecture document.
- Creating front-end pages that already have a clear design, with a prototype made and validated.
- Creating new methods, connecting to the documented API provider, and adding that to our already existing robust system.
- Creating a simple model/API, which might not integrate with other parts of the system.

What juniors might need help with

- Communicating with non-technical people: Some juniors might not be able to explain simply a piece of a technical system, and also won't be able to give accurate estimates for completion.
- Maintaining: Some juniors might need help to let go of the habit of just rushing through coding the tasks. In college, there was only a need to deliver as fast as it could, then the work is graded and tossed forever. In a professional setting, a project is as much as maintaining as it is delivering. 
- Paying attention to QA: Most people think that delivering value is just about getting more code written, but if this code has bugs that break production, the value of the new feature might be a net negative for a while.  

When junior engineers are starting to show signs of improvements:

- When they can understand the particularities of the systems and their limitations and start to see areas of improvement in the existing architecture.
- Being able to create technical specifications and agreements on how features will be built, able to get technical aligning within the team and also outside of it.
- By having experience in the process that the software is built as a professional team from concept until production: from the user requirements, agile rituals, development process, estimations, and timeline. Existing architecture solutions and style, code reviews, deployments, and monitoring.
