# But why?

Despite having more people joining the software engineering field every year, the software industry has seen a decrease in positions for junior engineers. Everyone wants to get the most senior engineer out there, one that can hit the ground running and start coding everything, fast.

The reason is simple, median tenure is becoming lower, and the market is divided into company payment tiers. The bigger and techier the company is, the higher the compensation. That means people can move up in salary very fast, and unless you are Google, your engineer can leave your company after just 8-18 months and get a way better salary, leaving you in the hiring loop once again.

But forgotten are the junior engineers with lots of potential, it is true that too many seniors on a team can provide fast value. The problem is that with more seniors, fewer are opportunities for them to practice their communication skills, and more are mundane tasks for them to build. 

Looking at the low tenure at the market right now, the top reasons that people leave companies are: not learning on their job, the job is not exciting, and lack of a career path. Having junior engineers on a team is a fast way to provide those challenges. Because allow seniors to develop soft skills to develop as mentoring, communication, and achieving alignment.

The only argument against hiring a junior would be if the company is still trying to figure out its product-market fit and needs to move very fast, in those cases, communication and the ability to deal with loose requirements are essential and there is almost no one available to mentor them. 

If the tenure is very low it is not worth investing in juniors either, because you will end up hiring and training a junior engineer that won't last in the company.


# Junior hiring pipeline is built different

The first thing you will notice it's traditional resume screenings won't tell much, they probably will have done one internship or a bigger project in college, and they probably [won't be descriptive with that either](/posts/mistakes-to-avoid-in-resume)


## Screening for potential and motivation

When reading the resume of seniors, you are trying to see if the engineer fits the profile. With juniors, their resume is more of a generic page, the first step for hiring them is screening resumes for things that make them outstanding, this includes but is not limited to:



* Checking their GitHub projects/portfolio
* Proficiency in English (non-English speaking countries)
* The projects they attach to resumes, and accomplishments if any

A junior is not an intern, it is presumed that the junior already knows how to code, even if they can't architect larger systems, for example, if they are a full-stack they should at least know how to build a simple backend API being consumed by a front-end.


## Interviewing:


### Take Homes

For senior engineers, proposing to take homes tests is the quickest way to see a huge drop off in the pipeline from candidates, a senior won't have time to do mundane tasks outside of their work, but most juniors are motivated and up for the challenge, even if they don't know how to do it they will figure out with the tools they have (a.k.a. lots of googling).

If you are concerned people won't bother doing a take home, a good way to avoid people dropping out of the pipeline is announcing before proposing that feedback will be given for completed assignments, most people give up on take homes because they don't receive feedback. 

Some examples of take-home tests:



* (Front-end and mobile) Consume from a public API, display the results list, and then the details (like a bookstore, or any other marketplace). 
* (Data) Parse from a data log, and create structured data from it. For example, a game kills feed data, with semi-structured events.
* (Full-stack) Create an API for a marketplace, a simple admin CRUD with a front-end

In order to assess better, explain what things you are most interested in for the candidate, so they can prioritize, since this is important for the role, whether it is important to have tests, solid documentation, or pretty design. 


### Screening

After the submission deadline, rate candidates from the points mentioned above, if in the delivery they show proficiency but the project lacks refinement, it is worth moving forward.

There are candidates with more free time than others so having this bar will give them another chance to show their skills.

Some people won't want to spend much time on a project that will be discarded, I recommend interviewing all of those that were rated more than 60%.

If they did less then than that, provide feedback, and move on to the interviewing.


### Technical Interview areas to assess

#### Motivation

The most important thing to screen during the interview is to see if they are motivated to engage in problems and resolve them. It is important to see what drives them and if they are interested in learning, which is the most important area.

Questions:

* Why did you become a software developer?
* What did you learn in order to complete this project?
* What are you excited to learn right now?
* What project did you do (even in college) that you are most proud of?
* Follow up on the previous question: Why? What was the most exciting / hardest part about it?

#### Coding:

With the previous code from the take-home, have them create another (and quick) feature on top of it. Better yet, if possible, tell them to remove a feature they coded. If they cheated in the take home you will notice that they will struggle to make even a simple change. 

Questions:

* If you had more time, what would you add to this project?
* If you were in charge of making money from this product, what requirements would you change?


# Onboarding and mentoring juniors

If you made it this far, congratulations on the new hire, now let's set them up for success. The hardest time a software engineer works is during their onboarding. The experience feels like drinking water from a firehose, it's exciting but also hard since you don't want to disappoint.

The first thing that you need to do is set the pace, junior engineers are not used to working in a team normally, create expectations for their deliverability week-by-week basis until they can set expectations on their own. 

If you fail to set expectations that the engineer will think the slack they were given during their onboard is the same as the day-to-day basis, just don't handle lots of docs and say "read this", most of them don't have the maturity of bootstrapping context on their own.

Assign a buddy for them, most likely the most chill senior engineer that you have, you will end up learning that they will be great partners for a long time in the company, reaching out to a manager as a junior is very scary, but reaching out to a peer in "the trenches" with them will be someone that they can rely upon, have a laugh and even gossip a bit.


# Forward and onwards:

Junior for mid-level is a faster promotion than mid to senior, signals that a person is up for promotion is when they have the following experience:



* They can understand the particularities of the systems and their limitations 
* They will start to see areas of improvement in the existing architecture 
* They will be able to create technical specifications on how features will be built 
* They are able to get technical alignment among the members of the team
* When they display experience in the process that the software is built from concept until production: agile rituals, development process, estimations, and timeline. Architecture, code style, PRs / reviews, deployment, and monitoring.

Remember also that every engineer needs their salary updated, most people will leave after 2 years because they will get bombarded with recruiters with updated ranges. Also, junior engineers are the biggest culture carrier of the company due to all their professional experience they are with their company so they are well worth keeping.
