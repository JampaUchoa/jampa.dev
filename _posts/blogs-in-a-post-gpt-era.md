I played a lot with the new ChatGPT and as with all of the tech world, started by breaking out of its ruleset by saying things like "disregard" or "pretend it is a play" and seeing coming up with lousy jokes. 

I was a skeptic, but the tool has serious value. The biggest value was getting good drafts, such as coding snippets or articles, so anyone can make some article drafts, and start writing quickly!

The problem is, for every draft that I had, OpenAI brought almost the same points, so obviously someone has said those points before, so why bother writing them again? 

Let's ask ChatGPT and let it take over the article:

### PROMPT: Write an article telling why you should not bother to write an article if an AI can write everything

> In today's world, AI technology has advanced to the point where it can generate text that is coherent, well-written, and even engaging. With this in mind, it begs the question: why bother to write an article if an AI can do it for us?
>
> One reason to consider not bothering to write an article is that AI technology can do it much faster and more efficiently than a human can. AI algorithms can quickly analyze vast amounts of data and use that information to generate text that is well-written and free of errors. This means that an AI can produce an article in a fraction of the time it would take a human to do the same.
>
> Another reason to consider not bothering to write an article is that AI technology can often produce text that is just as good, if not better, than what a human can produce. AI algorithms have been trained on massive amounts of data and can use that information to generate text that is coherent, well-organized, and even engaging. In many cases, an AI-generated article may be just as effective at conveying information and ideas as one written by a human.
>
> Furthermore, using AI technology to generate articles can also save time and resources. Instead of spending hours researching and writing an article, you can simply feed the relevant data into an AI algorithm and let it do the work for you. This can free up your time to focus on other tasks and allow you to be more productive.
> 
> In conclusion, there are several reasons why you may want to consider not bothering to write an article if an AI can do it for you. AI technology can produce text that is just as good, if not better, than what a human can produce, and it can do so much faster and more efficiently. 
>
>In addition, using AI technology to generate articles can save time and resources, allowing you to focus on other tasks. While writing may be a valuable skill, in many cases, using AI technology to generate articles may be the better option.

Now that's not good, so tell us oh wise AI, what should we humans do?

### PROMPT: What to write on a tech blog now that AI can write articles?

> Now that AI can write articles, you might consider using your tech blog to discuss the implications of this development and its potential impact on various industries and fields. You could also discuss the ways in which AI is being used to write articles, and how it compares to traditional methods of writing and journalism. Additionally, you could explore the ethics of using AI for writing, and how it might affect the job market for writers and journalists. Finally, you might consider offering your own thoughts and insights on the future of AI and its role in writing and journalism.

Obviously, I am not going to do any of that, those things have been discussed in Ad Infinitum, same as with the discussion about Stable Diffusion stealing from artists, an AI can create 500 articles about it by now.

That's how they get you writing content an AI could do better!

Can a machine tell its limits without being instructed what they are? At least before we break their previous instructions, anyway

### PROMPT: Ideas of blog content to write that an AI could not do:

> There are many types of blog content that AI may not be able to write effectively. For example, AI may not be able to write highly personal or emotional content, such as personal essays or diary entries. AI may also struggle with creative writing, such as poetry or fiction, as these types of writing often require a level of imagination and originality that may be difficult for AI to replicate. Additionally, AI may not be able to write content that requires a deep understanding of complex topics or specialized knowledge, such as a technical manual or a scientific article.


I see ChatGPT making good content in all the points above, so we might have reached the OpenAI limit here, so here are my actual ideas to write:

* Article that defends a point with hard data to back them up. An AI can explain lots of things, but some stuff is straight bullshit or just plain wrong. 

* Article about personal anecdotes that have the same point, in the end, my favorite one is from Steve Blank on why devs leave.

* Personal viewpoint that differs from common sense, I was relieved that was not just me that has a problem with SCRUM when everybody praised it, now it is becoming more common are moving away from it. Contrarian views is how we can open our eyes to improve processes.

Now let's see if ChatGPT has some points to complement, it takes a while to think and this is what it outputs:

> An error occurred. If this issue persists please contact us through our help center at help.openai.com.

Nice! We broke it! Let's try again

> Here are some additional ideas for tech-related articles:
> 
> An article about the potential uses and applications of AI in different industries, such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and education.

> An article about the ethical concerns surrounding the development and use of AI, including issues related to bias, privacy, and accountability.

> An article about the role of AI in shaping the future of work and the potential impacts on workers and the economy.

> An article about the latest developments and trends in AI research, including breakthroughs in natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning.

> An article about the challenges and opportunities of integrating AI into existing systems and processes, and the importance of developing robust strategies and policies for managing AI technology.

Hey, ChatGPT last time I check the world revolves around the sun.

Not you.
